# Scrobble-Ninja
This is scrobble.ninja, a project that aims to replace the existing last.fm scrobblers. My killer feature is the ability to scrobble an entire album at once.
#Basic functionality

-Log in with last.fm
-grab music data from discogs
-select artist -> album -> track (optional)
-if no track is selected, entire album will be scrobbled (with appropriate timestamps!!) when the button is pressed

# How to use
You can't right now >:)
